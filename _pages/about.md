I am currently a 2nd-year graduate student at [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://ieem.sjtu.edu.cn/), [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), co-supervised by [Prof. Ershun Pan](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/panershun.html) and [Prof. Zhen Chen](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/chenzhen.html). I recieved BEng degree from the same department in 2023 along with a minor in Finance.
